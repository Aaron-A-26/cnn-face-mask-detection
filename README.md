# cnn-face-mask-detection

This repository contains files which demonstrate work done on a final project in my Applied Deep Learning class in the SP 2021 semester at Florida Polytechnic University.

I was required to utilize my knowledge of convulutional networks to develop a deep learning algorithm that could detect if a person
was or was not wearing a face mask in a given image.

For more information, please refer to the "Mini-project1-option4.pdf" file.
